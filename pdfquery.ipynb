    "You need a **_Serverless Cassandra with Vector Search_** database on [Astra DB](https://astra.datastax.com) to run this demo. As outlined in more detail [here](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/quickstart.html#_prepare_for_using_your_vector_database), you should get a DB Token with role _Database Administrator_ and copy your Database ID: these connection parameters are needed momentarily.\n",

    "- Setup: import dependencies, provide secrets, create the LangChain vector store;\n",
    "- Load data: you will populate the vector store with a number of \"The Onion\" headlines from a HuggingFace dataset;\n",
